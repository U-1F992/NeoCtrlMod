Control 3DS console externally via serial communication.

## Overview

Automatic control of the 3DS by a microcontroller has already been realized with [3DS controller mod](https://3dscapture.com/controller/) by loopy and [dekuNukem/3xtDS](https://github.com/dekuNukem/3xtDS), both of which are currently difficult to obtain or produce.

This project aims to re-document information related to the automation of the 3DS and to develop a microcontroller board that can be embedded and easily manufactured. In addition, we propose a different approach to touch screen operation than the 3xtDS.
