# 3ds-bss

(WIP) 3DS console externally controllable via serial communication.

## TODO

- [ ] Develop a flexible board to connect the TPs to the microcontroller.
- [ ] Enable the microcontroller to control buttons, pads, and touch panel.
- [ ] Develop a front-end GUI application.
- [ ] Develop a microcontroller board small enough to be embedded.

## Naming

BSS (「僕が先に好きだったのに」) is one of the subcategories of the Japanese pornography genre NTR (「寝取られ」, I guess it means about the same as "cuckold"). You know, NTR is used as a product code for Nintendo DS (but this one means "Nitro").
