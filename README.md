- PCB, FPC, firmware, Python library and example application included.
- Small enough to fit in a original housing.
- Buttons, slide pad, and touch screen supported.
  - IR not yet supported, but connected (contributions welcome).
- Aim to be fully documented.

Currently FPC is provided only for 3DS XL.

## Origin of the name

Qing Pi (青皮) is a herbal remedy made from the peel of unripe citrus fruits. It is named after [Citra](), the famous 3DS emulator, and "Citra" is derived from "CTR", the model number of 3DS series.
